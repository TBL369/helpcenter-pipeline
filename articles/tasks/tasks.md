# Tasks
The Tasks section in Enginy is your centralized action hub for every to-do generated by your campaigns. Use it to stay on top of pending work — calls to make, emails to send, and follow-ups to complete — so no lead falls through the cracks.

# How Tasks Work
Tasks are action items that Enginy creates automatically when a campaign sequence reaches a manual step — for example, a phone call to make, an email to draft, or a general to-do. Each task is linked to a specific contact, a campaign, and an owner (the team member responsible for completing it).

Every task has one of two statuses:
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin"><b>Status</b></p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin"><b>Meaning</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Pending</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The task has not been completed yet. Shown as an orange badge.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Completed</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The task has been finished. Shown as a green badge.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Each task also carries a type that indicates the kind of action required:
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin"><b>Type</b></p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin"><b>Description</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>TODO</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">A general action item (e.g., "Call Valentina (LinkedIn Not Accepted)").</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>CALL</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">A phone-call task (e.g., "Cold Call").</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>EMAIL</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">An email-related task (e.g., "Follow-up email").</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

> **Note:** Tasks also appear in the Inbox conversations alongside your other interactions with the lead.

# Navigate the Tasks Page
To open the Tasks page, navigate to **Tasks** in Enginy. The page is organized into two tabs — **Pending** and **Completed** — with a toolbar for filtering and sorting above the task list.

## Pending Tab
The **Pending** tab shows all tasks that still need to be done. Use this tab as your daily working queue to see what actions you need to take next.

## Completed Tab
The **Completed** tab shows all tasks that have been finished. It includes an additional **Completed** column (not present in the Pending tab) that shows when each task was marked as done. Use this tab to review your work history and confirm that tasks were handled.

## Task List Columns Reference
The task list displays the following columns. The **Completed** column only appears in the Completed tab.
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin"><b>Column</b></p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin"><b>Description</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Task</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The full task label, composed of a type prefix and a title (see Task Naming Convention below).</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Notes</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">A short note attached to the task. Displays <b>-</b> when no note has been added.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Contact</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The contact associated with the task, shown with a colored avatar and the contact's name.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Source</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The campaign that generated the task. Long names may appear truncated.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Created</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">When the task was created, in relative time format (e.g., "4 hours ago", "3 weeks ago").</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Completed</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">When the task was completed, in relative time format. Only visible in the Completed tab.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Status</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The current status of the task: <b>Pending</b> (orange) or <b>Completed</b> (green).</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Task Naming Convention
Each task label in the **Task** column follows a consistent format: **TYPE · Title**, where **TYPE** is the action prefix (TODO, CALL, or EMAIL) and **Title** is the descriptive name. For example: "CALL · Cold Call" or "TODO - Call Valentina (LinkedIn Not Accepted)".

# Filter and Sort Tasks
A toolbar above the task list provides three controls — **Campaign**, **Owner**, and **Sort** — available on both tabs. Use these controls to focus on the tasks that matter most to you right now.

## Filter by Campaign
1. Click the **Campaign** button in the toolbar.
2. Select one or more campaigns from the scrollable list.
The task list updates to show only tasks associated with the selected campaigns.

## Filter by Owner
1. Click the **Owner** button in the toolbar.
2. Use the **Search…** text field at the top of the dropdown to narrow the list by name or email.
3. Select a team member from the list. Each entry displays a colored avatar, the member's name, and their email address.
The task list updates to show only tasks assigned to the selected owner.

## Sort Tasks
Click the **Sort** button in the toolbar and select one of the available options:
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin"><b>Sort Option</b></p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin"><b>Behavior</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Newest first</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Displays the most recently created tasks at the top.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Oldest first</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Displays the earliest created tasks at the top.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Recently completed</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Displays the most recently completed tasks at the top. Most useful in the Completed tab.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>First completed</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Displays the earliest completed tasks at the top. Most useful in the Completed tab.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

> **Tip:** The **Recently completed** and **First completed** sort options are most useful when viewing the Completed tab to review recent work or find older completed tasks.

# View Task Details
Click any row in the task list to open the task details panel — a side drawer that slides in from the right. To close the panel, click the **X** button in its top-right corner.

The panel gives you a complete breakdown of the task, including its type, associated contact, campaign, owner, and any notes or description.

## Task Details Fields Reference
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin"><b>Field</b></p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin"><b>Description</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Status</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Current status: <b>Pending</b> (orange) or <b>Completed</b> (green).</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Title</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The descriptive name of the task (without the type prefix).</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Type</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The task type: <b>TODO</b>, <b>CALL</b>, or <b>EMAIL</b>.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Contact</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The contact associated with the task, displayed with a colored avatar and full name.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Campaign</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The campaign that generated or is associated with the task.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Owner</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The team member assigned to the task, displayed with a colored avatar and name.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Created</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">When the task was created, in relative time format (e.g., "about 4 hours ago").</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Completed</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">When the task was completed, in relative time format. Only visible for completed tasks.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Description</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">A free-text description providing additional context about the task.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Notes</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">A text input area for adding your own notes to the task.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Add a Note to a Task
1. Click a task row to open the task details panel.
2. Scroll to the **Notes** field at the bottom of the panel.
3. Click the field (it displays the placeholder text **Add a note…** when empty).
4. Type your note.
> **Tip:** Use notes to record call outcomes, capture follow-up details, or leave context for teammates who may pick up the task.

# Complete a Task
1. Click a task row in the **Pending** tab to open the task details panel.
2. Click the **Complete** button at the bottom-right corner of the panel.
Once completed, the task automatically moves from the **Pending** tab to the **Completed** tab and its status changes from **Pending** (orange) to **Completed** (green).

> **Note:** The **Complete** button includes a small dropdown chevron beside it with an additional option: **Complete & Pause**, which completes the task and pauses the campaign sequence for that lead. Use this when you need to stop further automated outreach to a specific contact.

> **Important:** The **Complete** button is only available for tasks with a **Pending** status. Tasks already marked as **Completed** do not display this button.

# Practical Use Cases
Below are common ways teams use the Tasks section effectively.

**Daily workflow management:** Start your day by opening the **Pending** tab, filtering by your name in the **Owner** dropdown, and sorting by **Oldest first** to prioritize overdue tasks. Work through your queue by opening each task, taking the required action, adding a note with the outcome, and clicking **Complete**.

**Team lead oversight:** Filter by **Campaign** to see how tasks for a specific campaign are progressing, or filter by **Owner** to review a team member's workload. Switch to the **Completed** tab to verify that tasks are being handled on time.

**Coordinating multi-channel outreach:** When a campaign generates a CALL task after a LinkedIn message goes unanswered, use the task details panel to review the contact and campaign context before placing the call. After the call, add a note summarizing the conversation and complete the task.

**Pausing outreach for a lead:** If during a call or follow-up you learn that a contact is not the right fit or asks to be contacted later, use the **Complete & Pause** option to mark the task as done and stop the campaign sequence for that lead.

# FAQs
### Q1: How do I complete a task?
Click the task row in the **Pending** tab to open the task details panel, then click the green **Complete** button at the bottom-right of the panel. The task moves to the **Completed** tab automatically.

### Q2: What happens when I click Complete and Pause?
The task is marked as completed (it moves to the **Completed** tab) and the campaign sequence for that specific lead is paused. No further automated steps will be executed for that lead until the campaign is resumed.

### Q3: Can I filter tasks by campaign and owner at the same time?
Yes. The **Campaign** and **Owner** filters in the toolbar can be combined. For example, you can select a specific campaign and then select a specific team member to see only tasks assigned to that person within that campaign.

### Q4: Where do tasks come from?
Tasks are generated automatically by campaign sequences when a manual step is reached — such as a phone call, a manual email, or a general to-do. Each task is linked to the contact and campaign that triggered it.

### Q5: Can I reopen a completed task?
No. Once a task is marked as completed, it moves permanently to the **Completed** tab. If you need to take further action on the same contact, you can do so directly from the Inbox or by creating a new campaign step.

### Q6: Do tasks also appear in the Inbox?
Yes. Tasks are displayed in the Inbox conversations alongside your other interactions with each lead, giving you full context without switching between sections.
