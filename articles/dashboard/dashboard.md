<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Card</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">What It Shows</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Credits Balance</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Available credits versus total contracted credits. Includes a <b>View plan</b> link to the credits section.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Total Imported</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Total number of Contacts and Companies imported into the platform.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Campaigns (Summary)</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Number of conversations initiated with contacts and the reply rate.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

# Performance Charts
The central area of the Dashboard contains visual representations of your key performance metrics.

## Contacts Funnel
Visualizes your contact pipeline across three stages:
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Stage</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Description</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Imported</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Total contacts brought into the platform</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Enriched</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Contacts that have been enriched with additional data</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Exported</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Contacts exported to external systems or CRMs</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The funnel chart allows you to:
-   Filter by time range.
-   Analyze conversion rates between stages.
-   Identify bottlenecks in your prospecting workflow.
    
> **Tip:** Use the time-range selector on the funnel to compare different periods and spot trends in your prospecting pipeline.

## Campaigns Chart
A graphical comparison of outreach volume versus responses:
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Metric</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Description</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Contacted</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Number of contacts reached through campaigns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Replied</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Number of contacts who responded</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

You can adjust the time grouping using the selector:

# FAQs
### Q1: Does the Total Imported count include deleted contacts?
Yes. The Total Imported metric reflects the historical total of all contacts and companies ever imported into the platform, including those that have been subsequently deleted.

### Q2: Can I customize the time range for all Dashboard metrics?
Most Dashboard cards and charts support time-range filtering. Look for the time selector (for example, "Last 30 days") on each component to adjust the displayed period.

### Q3: What is the difference between Contacted and Replied in the Campaigns chart?
**Contacted** represents the total number of contacts who received outreach through your campaigns (via LinkedIn or email). **Replied** shows how many of those contacts responded. The ratio between these two values determines your reply rate.

### Q4: How often is the Dashboard data updated?
Dashboard metrics are updated in real time as activities occur within the platform. However, some aggregated metrics may take a few minutes to reflect the most recent changes.

### Q5: Where can I see more detailed campaign analytics?
The Dashboard provides a summary view. For detailed campaign analytics, navigate to the Analytics module from the main navigation menu.
