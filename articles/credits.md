| **Plan** | View your current plan and change it or purchase additional credits |
| **Credits** | View credit usage history broken down by time, user, and action type |

| **Plan & Credits** | Explore plans and estimate credits using the built-in credit calculator, pricing comparison, and ROI estimator |

---

# Core Concepts

Credits are the unit of consumption in Enginy. Every action you perform on contacts — such as scraping data, enriching contact details, running AI variables, or executing workflows — costs a specific number of credits. Your subscription plan determines how many credits you receive each month, and you can purchase add-on credits if you need more.

Conversations represent the outbound messages (emails and LinkedIn messages) your identities send. The number of conversations an identity can generate is naturally determined by its sending capacity. There is no additional hard limit imposed on conversations beyond that capacity.

---

# Quick Summary

At the top of the menu you will see a quick summary displaying:

- **Credits Left** — Your remaining credit balance.
- **Days Until Renewal** — The number of days until your plan renews.

---

# Plan Overview

## Plan Details

The Plan tab displays a full breakdown of your current subscription status:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Plan** | The name of your active plan |
| **Identities** | The number of identities included in your plan |
| **Plan Credits** | The total credits allocated by your base plan |

## Manage Your Subscription

# Credit Usage History

The **Credits** tab lets you track exactly how your credits are being consumed. You can analyze usage by time, user, and specific action type.

## Actions That Consume Credits

**Credits Usage by User**

Tracks how credits are consumed by different team members. Use this chart to monitor individual consumption patterns across your organization.

# Monthly Conversations

The **Conversations** tab provides visibility into conversation activity within your account. The number of conversations each identity can generate is naturally determined by its sending capacity (emails and LinkedIn messages), but there is no additional hard limit imposed on conversations.

# Plan and Credits

The **Plan & Credits** tab provides tools to help you estimate your credit needs, compare available pricing plans, and calculate the expected return on investment from using Enginy. This tab contains three sub-sections: **Calculate your credits**, **Pricing plans**, and **Estimated ROI**.

## Credit Calculator

The credit calculator helps you estimate how many credits you will need per month based on your expected usage.

**Step 1 — Set your contacts per month**

Use the slider or the input field to set the number of contacts you plan to process each month.

**Step 2 — Select your actions**

Select which actions you plan to use. Each action has a specific credit cost per result:

| Action | Credit Cost |
|--------|-------------|
| **Extract company and contact data** | 1 credit/result |

| **Phone enrichment** | 40 credits/result |
| **Google Maps Data** | 1 credit/result |
| **Technology Stack Data** | 1 credit/result |
| **Job Posting Data** | 1 credit/result |
| **Email Verification** | 1 credit/result |
| **Phone Verification** | 3 credits/result |
| **AI Variables** | 3 credits/field (quantity adjustable) |

**Step 3 — Review your estimate**

Based on your selections, the calculator displays a summary panel showing:

- **Monthly credits needed** — The total estimated credits for your configuration.
- **Contacts per month** — The number of contacts you entered.
- **Credits per contact** — The average credit cost per contact based on the actions you selected.

> **Note:** The credit calculator is an estimation tool. Your actual consumption may vary depending on the specific actions performed on each contact.

## Pricing Plans

The Pricing plans sub-section allows you to compare all available Enginy plans side by side. You can toggle between **Without Phones** and **With Phones** to see how plans differ depending on whether phone enrichment capabilities are included.

# Renewal Policy

Understanding how credit resets work is important for planning your usage:

| Aspect | Policy |
|--------|--------|
| **Reset Date** | Credits are automatically renewed on the 1st of each month |
| **Rollover Policy** | As a general rule, credits that are not consumed will **not** be carried over to the following month |
| **Exceptions** | There may be occasional and specific exceptions to the rollover policy depending on your agreement |

> **Warning:** Plan your credit usage accordingly each month. Unused credits typically expire at the end of the billing period and do not accumulate.

# FAQs

## How can I purchase additional credits?

You have two options. First, click the **Buy More** button in the Plan tab to connect with an agent via the platform chat. Second, contact your Account Manager directly. Both methods will connect you with your Account Manager, who will evaluate your needs and offer a customized solution.
