# AI Finder

AI Finder lets you discover contacts and companies from LinkedIn using natural language queries instead of manually configuring complex filters in LinkedIn Sales Navigator. Describe your ideal prospects in everyday language, and AI Finder automatically builds an optimized search — returning matching results ready to import into Enginy.

# Before You Start

- Make sure your **AI Playbook** and **Personal Information** are properly configured in Enginy. These settings help the system understand your target audience, industry, and sales focus, allowing both AI Finder and AI Recommendations to deliver more relevant results.

# How It Works

Instead of selecting dozens of individual filters like job title, industry, or location, you describe what you are looking for in plain language and AI Finder automatically interprets your intent, generates the right filters, and returns matching results.

**Example query:**

> "CTOs at early-stage startups in Barcelona"

The AI will automatically build an optimized LinkedIn search with the correct job titles, industries, company sizes, and locations — returning matching contacts or companies ready to import.

## Search Step by Step

1. **Describe your target** — Type a natural language query into the AI Finder search field (e.g., "Marketing directors at fintech startups in London").
2. **Review generated filters** — The system analyzes your query and builds an optimized LinkedIn Sales Navigator search. Review the filters it has selected.
3. **Adjust if needed** — Modify, add, or remove any generated filters before proceeding.
4. **Import results** — Add matching contacts or companies directly from LinkedIn into Enginy.

> **Tip:** You can revisit your previous searches anytime through **Search History**.

# AI Recommendations

Alongside the AI Finder search field, Enginy offers AI Recommendations — dynamically generated suggestions that proactively surface relevant contacts and companies tailored to your Identity, existing clients, and activity on the platform.

## How AI Recommendations Work

Instead of building searches from scratch, AI Recommendations present ready-to-use queries that match your business focus. Each recommendation appears as a selectable pill directly below the AI Finder search input. Clicking one instantly generates a customized list of leads or companies aligned with your sales strategy.

> **Important:** For the most accurate and personalized recommendations, make sure your **AI Playbook** and **Personal Information** are properly configured. These settings help the system understand your target audience, industry, and sales focus, allowing AI Recommendations to deliver more relevant suggestions.

## Recommendation Types

AI Recommendations are categorized based on different prospecting strategies:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Recently Promoted** | Contacts who recently changed roles in your target market | "Revenue operations professionals who recently changed roles in Spain" |
| **Past Alumni** | Alumni from specific institutions with potential connection value | "Alumni from [University] in leadership positions" |
| **Leadership Experience** | Executives with specific professional backgrounds | "Tech CEOs and founders with sales operations backgrounds" |
| **From Existing Clients** | Decision makers at organizations you already work with | "Decision makers at [Company]'s current client organizations" |
| **AI Contact Discovery** | Contacts matching your ICP in strategic locations | "Spanish-speaking revenue operations professionals in major tech hubs" |
| **ICP-Aligned Companies** | Organizations matching your Ideal Customer Profile with buying signals | "Financial services companies with growth signals" or "Marketing agencies with active hiring signals" |
| **AI Company Discovery** | High-potential companies showing expansion indicators | "High-growth technology companies showing funding or expansion indicators" |

Recommendations evolve over time based on:

- Your defined Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- User behavior and engagement patterns
- Market trends and signals

This means your suggestions stay relevant and continue to surface new opportunities as your business focus changes.

# FAQs
