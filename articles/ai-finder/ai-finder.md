# AI Finder
AI Finder lets you discover contacts and companies from LinkedIn using natural language queries instead of manually configuring complex filters in LinkedIn Sales Navigator. Describe your ideal prospects in everyday language, and AI Finder automatically builds an optimized search — returning matching results ready to import into Enginy.

# Before You Start
Make sure your **AI Playbook** and **Personal Information** are properly configured in Enginy. These settings help the system understand your target audience, industry, and sales focus, allowing both AI Finder and AI Recommendations to deliver more relevant results.

---

# How It Works
Instead of selecting dozens of individual filters like job title, industry, or location, you describe what you are looking for in plain language and AI Finder automatically interprets your intent, generates the right filters, and returns matching results.

### **Example query:**

```
"CTOs at early-stage startups in Barcelona"
```

The AI will automatically build an optimized LinkedIn search with the correct job titles, industries, company sizes, and locations — returning matching contacts or companies ready to import.

### Search Step by Step
1.  **Describe your target** — Type a natural language query into the AI Finder search field (e.g., "Marketing directors at fintech startups in London").
2.  **Review generated filters** — The system analyzes your query and builds an optimized LinkedIn Sales Navigator search. Review the filters it has selected.
3.  **Adjust if needed** — Modify, add, or remove any generated filters before proceeding.
4.  **Import results** — Add matching contacts or companies directly from LinkedIn into Enginy.
**Tip:** You can revisit your previous searches anytime through **Search History** in the AI Finder textbox

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440079/helpcenter/ai-finder-2.png)

## How AI Recommendations Work

Instead of building searches from scratch, AI Recommendations present ready-to-use queries that match your business focus. Each recommendation appears as a selectable pill directly below the AI Finder search input. Clicking one instantly generates a customized list of leads or companies aligned with your sales strategy.

**Important:** For the most accurate and personalized recommendations, make sure your **AI Playbook** and **Personal Information** are properly configured. These settings help the system understand your target audience, industry, and sales focus, allowing AI Recommendations to deliver more relevant suggestions.

## Recommendation Types

AI Recommendations are categorized based on different prospecting strategies:
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Type</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80; width: 213px;"><p class="no-margin">Description</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Example</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Recently Promoted</b></p></td><td style="width: 213px;"><p class="no-margin">Contacts who recently changed roles in your target market.</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">"Recently promoted sales leaders in Europe".</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>People You May Know</b></p></td><td style="width: 213px;"><p class="no-margin">Suggested leads based on your network and activity (LinkedIn recommendations).</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">"Universitat de Barcelona alumni in tech sales".</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>AI Contact Discovery</b></p></td><td style="width: 213px;"><p class="no-margin">Contacts matching your ICP in strategic locations.</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">"LinkedIn-active tech sales leaders across Europe".</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>ICP Aligned Companies</b></p></td><td style="width: 213px;"><p class="no-margin">Organizations matching your Ideal Customer Profile with buying signals.</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">"Financial services firms actively hiring marketing teams" or "Growing B2B SaaS firms actively hiring sales teams".</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>AI Company Discovery</b></p></td><td style="width: 213px;"><p class="no-margin">High-potential companies showing expansion indicators.</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">"Enterprise tech companies with leadership transitions".</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Recommendations evolve over time based on:

-   Your defined Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
    
-   User behavior and engagement patterns
    
-   Market trends and signals
    

This means your suggestions stay relevant and continue to surface new opportunities as your business focus changes.

# FAQs
### Q1: Can I use AI Finder with sources other than LinkedIn?

Not yet. AI Finder currently works exclusively with LinkedIn imports. Support for additional sources is planned for future releases.

### Q2: Can I edit the filters that AI Finder generates?

Yes. After AI Finder generates filters from your query, you can review, modify, add, or remove any filter before importing contacts or companies.

### Q3: What types of searches does AI Finder support?

AI Recommendations are powered by your Identity and AI Playbook configuration. The system uses these inputs to generate tailored lead and company suggestions that align with your business goals.

Yes. Once you select a recommendation, you can adjust any filters, exclude specific results, or export the list to campaigns or workflows.

### Q7: How is AI Finder different from AI Recommendations?
