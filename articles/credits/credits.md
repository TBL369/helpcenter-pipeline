# Core Concepts
Credits are the unit of consumption in Enginy. Every action you perform on contacts — such as scraping data, enriching contact details, running AI variables, or executing workflows — costs a specific number of credits. Your subscription plan determines how many credits you receive each month, and you can purchase add-on credits if you need more.

Conversations represent the outbound messages (emails and LinkedIn messages) your identities send. The number of conversations an identity can generate is naturally determined by its sending capacity. There is no additional hard limit imposed on conversations beyond that capacity.

---

# Overview
To open the Credits section, click the **View Usage** button on the left-side panel.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440107/helpcenter/credits-1.png)

This section is divided into four tabs:
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Tab</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Purpose</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Plan</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">View your current plan, credit top-up historical data, and purchase additional credits and identities.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Credits</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">View credit usage history broken down by time, user, and action type, and purchase additional credits.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Conversations</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">View monthly conversation usage broken down by time, identity, and originating campaign.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Plan &amp; Credits</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Explore plans and estimate credits using the built-in credit calculator, pricing comparison, and ROI estimator</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

# Plan Overview
Use the **Plan** tab to review your current subscription details.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440109/helpcenter/credits-2.png)

## Plan Details
The Plan tab displays a full breakdown of your current subscription status:
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Field</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Description</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Plan</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The name of your active plan.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Plan Credits</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The total credits allocated by your base plan.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Add-on Credits</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Extra credits purchased separately.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Identities</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The number of identities included in your plan.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Price</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The monthly cost of your subscription.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Next Renewal</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">The date when your plan renews.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Manage Your Subscription
The identities are used to engage leads through campaigns. You can click the **Identities** icon to purchase additional identities. In the purchase modal, you’ll see the total cost before confirming. Pricing may vary depending on your contracted plan and the number of identities you already have and how many you purchase.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440109/helpcenter/credits-3.png)

You can also view your **Enginy Credits** balance: available credits *(Plan Credits + Add-on Credits)* / total monthly contracted credits. Click **Add credits** to purchase a top-up — either a one-time or recurring purchase.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440109/helpcenter/credits-4.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440110/helpcenter/credits-5.png)

> **Note:** You can use these buttons to quickly purchase credits and identities. You can also contact your Account Manager, who can review your needs and propose a tailored solution. If you want to change your plan, reach out to your Account Manager directly to handle it.

# Credit Usage History
The **Credits** tab lets you track exactly how your credits are being consumed. You can analyze usage by time, user, and specific action type.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440110/helpcenter/credits-6.png)

## Actions That Consume Credits
The system tracks credit usage for the following activities:
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Action Type</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Description</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Scrapings</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Extracting data for companies or contacts.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Enrichments</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Finding emails, phone numbers, and other data such as from TheirStack or Crunchbase.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>AI Variables</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Executing AI to generate personalized data or messages.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

> **Note:** You can buy more credits through the **Add More Credits** button, the same way as in the Plan tab.

## Filters and Time Ranges
You can filter credit usage data by the following time ranges:
-   Today
-   Yesterday
-   This Week
-   Last Week
-   This Month
-   Last Month
-   This Year
    
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440110/helpcenter/credits-7.png)

> **Note:** You can custom the Date Range by clicking the numbers from the calendar modal.

Total credits used are shown in a chart for the selected **Date Range** as a dotted line, where each dot represents a day. The chart can be grouped by **day**, **week**, or **month**.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440110/helpcenter/credits-8.png)

## Usage Charts
The Credit Usage History view includes two detailed charts for analysis:

### Credits Usage by Action Type
Tracks how credits are consumed across different actions (for example, AI completion versus Enrich contact email). Use this chart to understand which activities consume the most resources.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440110/helpcenter/credits-9.png)

### Credits Usage by User
Tracks how credits are consumed by different team members. Use this chart to monitor individual consumption patterns across your organization.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440107/helpcenter/credits-10.png)

# Monthly Conversations
The **Conversations** tab provides visibility into conversation activity within your account. The number of conversations each identity can generate is naturally determined by its sending capacity (emails and LinkedIn messages), but there is no additional hard limit imposed on conversations. This section allows you to monitor volume and trends over time.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440107/helpcenter/credits-11.png)

## Conversation Breakdowns
You can analyze conversations through three different breakdowns:
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Breakdown</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Visualization</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Description</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>By Time</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Line graph</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Shows daily or weekly or monthly conversation usage over time.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>By Campaigns</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Pie chart</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Displays "Conversations usage by campaigns" — tracks consumption across different active campaigns.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>By Identities</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Pie chart</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Displays "Conversations usage by identities" — shows which team members are initiating the most conversations.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

# Plan and Credits
The **Plan & Credits** tab provides tools to help you estimate your credit needs, compare available pricing plans, and calculate the expected return on investment from using Enginy. This tab contains three sub-sections: **Calculate your credits**, **Pricing plans**, and **Estimated ROI**.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440108/helpcenter/credits-12.png)

## Credit Calculator
The credit calculator helps you estimate how many credits you will need per month based on your expected usage.

**Step 1 — Set your contacts per month**
Use the slider or the input field to set the number of contacts you plan to process each month.

**Step 2 — Select your actions**
Select which actions you plan to use. Each action has a specific credit cost per result:
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Action</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Credit Cost</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Extract company and contact data</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">1 credit/result</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Email enrichment</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">5 credits/result</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Phone enrichment</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">40 credits/result</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Google Maps Data</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">1 credit/result</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Technology Stack Data</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">1 credit/result</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Job Posting Data</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">1 credit/result</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Email Verification</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">1 credit/result</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Phone Verification</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">3 credits/result</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>AI Variables</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">3 credits/field (quantity adjustable)</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

**Step 3 — Review your estimate**
Based on your selections, the calculator displays a summary panel showing:
-   **Monthly credits needed** — The total estimated credits for your configuration.
-   **Contacts per month** — The number of contacts you entered.
-   **Credits per contact** — The average credit cost per contact based on the actions you selected.
    
> **Note:** The credit calculator is an estimation tool. Your actual consumption may vary depending on the specific actions performed on the platform.

## Pricing Plans
The Pricing plans sub-section allows you to compare all available Enginy plans side by side. You can toggle between **Without Phones** and **With Phones** to see how plans differ depending on whether phone enrichment capabilities are included.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440109/helpcenter/credits-13.png)
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Feature</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Basic</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Smart</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Business</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Enterprise</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Monthly price</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">599 EUR/month</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">799 EUR/month</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">1,199 EUR/month</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Custom</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Annual price</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">7,188 EUR/year</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">9,588 EUR/year</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">14,388 EUR/year</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Custom</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Credits/month</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">5,000</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">10,000</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">32,000</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Custom</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Contacts/month</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Up to 500</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Up to 1,000</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Up to 2,000</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Custom</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Identities included</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">1</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">2</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">4</p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Custom</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Estimated ROI Calculator
The Estimated ROI calculator helps you estimate how much additional revenue and time savings you can expect by using Enginy. It is divided into three panels.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/enginy/image/upload/v1771440109/helpcenter/credits-14.png)

### Increase in revenue

# Renewal Policy
Understanding how credit resets work is important for planning your usage:
<table role="presentation"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Aspect</p></td><td style="background-color: #d7efdc80;"><p class="no-margin">Policy</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Reset Date</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">Credits are automatically renewed on the 1st of each month.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Rollover Policy</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">As a general rule, credits that are not consumed will <b>not</b> be carried over to the following month.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="no-margin"><b>Exceptions</b></p></td><td><p class="no-margin">There may be occasional and specific exceptions to the rollover policy depending on your agreement or a concrete situation.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

> **Warning:** Plan your credit usage accordingly each month. Unused credits typically expire at the end of the billing period and do not accumulate.

---

# FAQs
### Q1: How can I purchase additional credits?
You have two options. First, click the **Add More Credits** button in the Plan tab to connect with an agent via the platform chat. Second, contact your Account Manager directly. Both methods will allow you to get more credits, but the first one is more autonomous and may be faster.

### Q2: What happens to my unused credits at the end of the month?
As a general rule, unused credits do not roll over to the following month. Your credit balance resets on the 1st of each month. However, there may be occasional and specific exceptions depending on your situation.

### Q3: Is there a hard limit on conversations per identity?
There is no hard limit on conversations. The number of conversations each identity can generate is naturally tied to its sending capacity (emails and LinkedIn messages).

The Conversations tab is provided so you can monitor volume and trends across your team.

### Q4: Can I see which team member is consuming the most credits?
Yes. In the Credits tab, the "Credits usage by user" chart tracks how credits are consumed by different team members. This allows you to monitor individual consumption patterns across your organization.

### Q5: How can I estimate how many credits I need each month?
Go to the **Plan & Credits** tab and open the **Calculate your credits** sub-section. Set the number of contacts you plan to process per month, select the actions you will use, and the calculator will show you the total monthly credits needed along with the average credits per contact.
