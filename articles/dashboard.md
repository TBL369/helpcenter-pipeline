# FAQs

## Q1: Does the Total Imported count include deleted contacts?

Yes. The Total Imported metric reflects the historical total of all contacts and companies ever imported into the platform, including those that have been subsequently deleted.

## Q2: Can I customize the time range for all Dashboard metrics?

Most Dashboard cards and charts support time-range filtering. Look for the time selector (for example, "Last 30 days") on each component to adjust the displayed period.

## Q3: What is the difference between Contacted and Replied in the Campaigns chart?

**Contacted** represents the total number of contacts who received outreach through your campaigns (via LinkedIn or email). **Replied** shows how many of those contacts responded. The ratio between these two values determines your reply rate.

Dashboard metrics are updated in real time as activities occur within the platform. However, some aggregated metrics may take a few minutes to reflect the most recent changes.
